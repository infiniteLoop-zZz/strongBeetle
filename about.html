            <h2>Strong Beetle origin story</h2>
            <p>Once upon a time in a bustling city<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">, there lived a fitness enthusiast named Max. Max had always been passionate about health and strength but was struggling to stick to a consistent workout routine. One sunny afternoon, as Max pondered their fitness journey in the local park, a curious sight was seen. A tiny beetle scuttled over, carrying a miniature dumbbell in its mandibles. Intrigued, Max reached out a hand, and watched with amazement as the beetle delicately placed the tiny weight in their palm.<br><br>
                Inspired by this unexpected encounter, Max embarked on a journey to create something truly revolutionary â€“ a fitness app that would harness the indomitable spirit of the beetle to motivate and guide people on their fitness journeys. And thus, Strong Beetle was born. With the beetle's unwavering determination as their guiding light, Max and the team developed an app that not only helped users build strength and endurance but also fostered a sense of camaraderie and determination, just like the resilient beetle that sparked the idea.</span></p>
